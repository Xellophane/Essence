views.py
 - Screen
    - Should contain a weakref dictionary with all of the items that need drawing.
        - Ex. Sprites, Menu's.
    - Items will have to register themselves.

Model
 - essence.py is the current model. Would like this seperated out to allow more modularity and edibility.
  - game.py should end up being the model. with essence.py being the engine container.

Controller
 - controllers.py currently houses the controllers. Would like this cleaned up a little bit.

Communicator
- eventhandler.py is the current communicator module. Fairly clean currently. Nothing currently desired here.

Separate model out
    ! get logic framerate and graphic framerate separate
