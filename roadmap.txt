# Current Condition and Wants outside of roadmap #
views.py
 - Screen
    - Should contain a weakref dictionary with all of the items that need drawing.
        - Ex. Sprites, Menu's.
    - Items will have to register themselves.

Model
 - essense.py is the current model. Would like this seperated out to allow more modularity and edibility.

Controller
 - controllers.py currently houses the controllers. Would like this cleaned up a little bit.

Communicator
- eventhandler.py is the current communicator module. Fairly clean currently. Nothing currently desired here.


# Roadmap #

Cleanup
    - clean up the codebase.
        - essence.py
        - views.py
            - Especially messy, cleaning this will help with the cleanup of essence.py

Player input/menu interaction
    - get menu interaction working
        - get mouse interaction working.

Separate model out
    ! get logic framerate and graphic framerate separate
    ! game.py should handle story and database stuff
      _ Should be able to drop in a new game.py and have an entirely different story
