views.py
 - Screen
    - Should contain a weakref dictionary with all of the items that need drawing.
        - Ex. Sprites, Menu's.
    - Items will have to register themselves.

Model
 - essense.py is the current model. Would like this seperated out to allow more modularity and edibility. 

Controller
 - controllers.py currently houses the controllers. Would like this cleaned up a little bit.

Communicator
- eventhandler.py is the current communicator module. Fairly clean currently. Nothing currently desired here.


# Roadmap #

Cleanup
    - clean up the codebase.
        - essence.py
        - views.py
            - Especially messy, cleaning this will help with the cleanup of essence.py

Player input/menu interation
    - get menu interaction working
        - get mouse interaction working.

Seperate model out
    ! get logic framerate and graphic framerate seperate
    ~ Seperate the model from essence.py
        - essence.py should just load modules and start game.
